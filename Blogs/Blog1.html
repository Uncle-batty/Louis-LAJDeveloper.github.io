                <h2>My Background</h2>
                <p>I’m a BCom Information Systems student, which means my coursework includes a blend of business and
                    technology. This combination can be a strong foundation for certain roles in the tech industry, such
                    as systems analyst, business analyst, or IT auditor.</p>

            <section class="content-section" id="opportunities">
                <h2>Opportunities in Tech</h2>
                <p>Roles like systems analyst, business analyst, and IT auditor are relatively accessible for BCom
                    graduates however software developer roles seem crazy to aim for. While these positions are within
                    reach, the journey to secure them involves a lot of effort and perseverance. I've had interviews and
                    assessments with companies like Enterlect, Vodacom, Standard Bank, Amazon, and several others.
                    Despite applying to over 70 places, I've only managed a handful of interviews.</p>

            <section class="content-section" id="skills-gap">
                <h2>The Skills Gap</h2>
                <p>While my degree includes coding, it doesn’t cover all the technical fundamentals you need for most
                    software jobs. For instance, topics like data structures, core algorithms, and time complexity are
                    essential but often not thoroughly taught in a BCom program.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data Structures</li>
                    <li>Core Algorithms</li>
                    <li>Time Complexity</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These concepts frequently come up in interviews and are critical to success. Hence, they need to be
                    self-taught.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="content-section" id="experience-paradox">
                <h2>The Experience Paradox</h2>
                <p>Many junior positions require 2-5 years of experience, and most graduate programs prefer BSc
                    students. It’s a common struggle, but not insurmountable. People do get jobs without degrees, though
                    they usually have significant self-taught skills and project experience.</p>

            <section class="content-section" id="unique-advantage">
                <h2>Leveraging Your Unique Advantage</h2>
                <p>As an Information Systems (BCom IT) student, you often have more practical knowledge and business
                    acumen compared to more mathematically focused degrees. This can be an advantage in roles that
                    require understanding both technology and business processes.</p>

            <section class="content-section" id="tips">
                <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Self-Study:</strong> Invest time in learning the technical fundamentals that your degree
                        might not cover. Use resources like Visualgo and LeetCode to master data structures and
                        algorithms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Practical Experience:</strong> Gain practical experience through internships, side
                        projects, and part-time jobs. This not only builds your resume but also gives you hands-on
                        skills.</li>
                    <li><strong>Understand Technical Concepts:</strong> Familiarize yourself with key programming
                        concepts and software development methodologies. Here are some areas to focus on:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Time Complexity: Understand how to analyze the efficiency of algorithms.</li>
                        <li>Data Structures: Know which data structures to use and when.</li>
                        <li>Encryption: Learn the basics of keys and encryption methods.</li>
                        <li>OOP Concepts: Understand interfaces, abstractions, polymorphism, and inheritance.</li>
                        <li>Internet Protocols: Get a grasp on TCP, UDP, IP, HTTP/s, DNS, SSL, and TSL.</li>
                        <li>Version Control: Learn how to use tools like Git.</li>
                        <li>DevOps: Know the basics of DevOps practices.</li>
                        <li>Sorting Algorithms: Familiarize yourself with common sorting algorithms.</li>
                        <li>SQL Concepts: Understand joins and other SQL fundamentals.</li>
                        <li>Frameworks: Learn popular frameworks used in the industry.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>While the journey is challenging, it’s not impossible. I've secured an offer from Nintex, and many of
                    my peers with the same degree have also landed roles in the tech industry. Don’t be discouraged by
                    the obstacles. With perseverance, continuous learning, and a proactive approach, you can succeed.
                </p>
                <p>Remember, every interview is a learning opportunity. Show up,as your best self, be prepared to impress, and keep pushing forward. Your unique combination of business and technical
                skills can set you apart in the software industry.</p></section>
